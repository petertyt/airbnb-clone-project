### üß† Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying and documenting design properties (such as color palettes, typography, spacing, and UI elements) early in the design process is critical because:

- It **ensures design consistency** across the entire application.
- It **speeds up development** by providing a clear style guide for developers and designers.
- It **improves collaboration** between UI/UX teams and developers by eliminating guesswork.
- It **enhances user experience (UX)** by maintaining a coherent and professional interface.
- It **simplifies scalability** if the project grows or undergoes redesigns in the future.

A well-defined design system serves as the visual and structural foundation for a professional and user-friendly application.
